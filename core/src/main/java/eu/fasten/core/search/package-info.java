/** <h1>A search engine over the FASTEN knowledge base</h1> 
 * 
 * <p>This package contains an implementation of a ranked search engine over the FASTEN knowledge base.
 * The engine makes it possible to query for (co)reachable methods, possibly filtered using JSON
 * queries over metadata (e.g., information about vulnerabilities or licensing).
 * 
 * <p>The {@linkplain eu.fasten.core.search.SearchEngine class documentation} shows in detail
 * how to access the search engine features, and Deliverable 5.5 explains in some detail its design.
